Python for Data Science


Course Overview

This accelerated course covers the basics of Python programming for data science students. Though you will be programming in Python, you can transfer all concepts learned to other languages. We will be learning the basics of programming, such as variables, branching, loops, and data structures.


Objectives

• Define and describe basic Python concepts. This includes but is not limited to variables, branching, looping, functions, data structures, file I/O, exceptions, and classes.
• Take a basic problem and break it down into tasks that can be done by the computer.
• Write simple programs that perform these tasks.
• Debug a program that is not working.
