from car import Car  # Import the Car class from the file where it's defined

# In a separate file, called test_classes.py, complete the class for the
# unit tests. Import your Car class from homework 4.

# 1. Create the following instances for your unit tests :
# car1 = Car("yellow", 2010, "Ferrari", "LaFerrari", 3, "gas", 245, 6)
# car2 = Car("red", 2010, "Lambourghini", "Aventador", 3, "gas", 252, 6.2)




# 2. Write an unit test, called test_betterGasMileage, that checks that the
# betterGasMileage for car1 and car2 is working properly (keep in mind that
# you're using float values for mpg, so use the appropriate test).




# 3. Write an unit test, called test_changeColor, that checks that the attribute
# color of car1 above corresponds to the correct color value, then change the
# car's color to blue using the changeColor method, and check that the car's
# color is now blue.




# 4. Write an unit test, called test_numCars, that checks that the class variable
# num_cars is equal to 2 after having created the car1 and car2 variables.
